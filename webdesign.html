        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        <h4>Main root</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>html tag</strong>: <br><p>Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, <br>so it is also referred to as the root element.<br> All other elements must be descendants of this element.</p> 

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Document Metadata</h3>
        <p>Metadata contains information about the page. <br>This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. <br>Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>base tag</strong>: <br><p>Specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. <br>There can be only one such element in a document.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>head tag</strong>: <br><p>Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.</p>

            <li>    
                <strong>link tag</strong>: <br><p>Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. <br>This element is most commonly used to link to CSS, <br>but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sectioning root</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>body tag</strong>: <br><p>represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.</p>
