        <h3>Features of HTML5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nav Tag <br><p>The nav tag helps in defining a set of navigation links. 
                It helps create a website section containing navigation links (within the current document or to another document). A few examples 
                of navigation links are the table of contents and indexes.</p></li>

            </li>
            <li>Audio and Video Tags <br>
            <p>With Audio and Video tags, developers can embed videos or audio into their websites. 
                For styling the video tag, developers can use CSS and CSS3.</p>
            <p>
                <video width="400px" height="300px" controls>
                  <source src=" movie.mp4 " type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                </p></li>

                <li>Header <br> <p>The header element in HTML5 contains introductory content. 
                    It can include a set of introductory or navigational support on a website. Typically, the header element contains heading elements, 
                    logos or icons, a search form, author information, etc</p>
                <p>example: <br>

                </li>
            <li>Footer <p>The footer tag defines the footer of a document or a section. 
                Typically, the footer contains information related to the author, copyright, contact information, sitemap, related documents, back-to-top links, etc. 
                There can be more than one footer element in one document.</p>

                </figure>
            </p></li>
            <li>Canvas Tag <br>
                <p>The canvas tag in HTML5 helps users draw graphics or images on the fly using JavaScript. 
                    We can use it for drawing paths, boxes, circles, adding images, etc. The canvas tag has two attributes: 
                    width and height for setting the width and height of the canvas.</p>
             <p>example <br>
                <canvas id="Canvas1" width="400" height="100" style="border:2px solid;">  
                </canvas> </p>
            </li>
            <li>Mark <br>
            <p>The mark element highlights a particular text of 
                special interest to the user in an HTML document.</p>

        <h3>HTML Entities</h3>
        <p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.

            If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
            
            Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
            An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). </p>

            <h3>Web Accessibilty</h3>
            <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites and web applications 
                usable and understandable by people with disabilities. It ensures that all individuals, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, 
                can access and interact with online content effectively.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Screen Readers: </b>
                    <p>Screen readers are software programs that convert digital text into synthesized speech. 
                        They enable blind or 
                        visually impaired users to listen to the content on a webpage.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Braille Displays:</b>
                        <p>Braille displays are physical devices that convert digital text into Braille characters. 
                            Users who are blind or have significant visual 
                            impairments can read and navigate web content using these devices.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Screen Magnifiers: </b>
                        <p>Screen magnification software and hardware tools help users 
                            with low vision by enlarging on-screen text and images. 
                            They also allow users to adjust contrast and colors.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Voice Recognition Software: </b>
                        <p>Voice recognition software, like Dragon NaturallySpeaking, 
                            enables users with mobility impairments 
                            to navigate and interact with websites using voice commands.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Keyboard Navigation: </b>
                        <p>Some individuals with mobility impairments may rely on keyboard-only navigation, 
                            bypassing the need for a mouse. Web designers should ensure 
                            that websites are fully navigable using keyboard inputs alone.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Alternative Input Devices:</b>
                        <p>These include various devices like sip-and-puff systems, head-tracking devices, 
                            and eye-tracking technology that allow individuals with severe motor 
                            disabilities to control a computer and access the web.</p></li>

                        <li><b>Captioning and Subtitling: </b>
                        <p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing users benefit from captions and subtitles for 
                            multimedia content, such as videos. These provide 
                            a text-based representation of spoken words and sound effects.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Text-to-Speech Software:</b>
                        <p>Text-to-speech (TTS) software, such as ReadSpeaker and Natural 
                            Reader, can help users with reading difficulties or 
                            learning disabilities by converting written text into spoken words.</p></li>
                        <li><b>High-Contrast Themes: </b>
                        <p>Websites that offer high-contrast themes make it easier for users with low vision 
                            or color blindness to read and interact with content.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Accessible PDFs and Documents: </b>
                        <p>Providing accessible PDFs and documents ensures that people with disabilities 
                            can access written 
                            information using screen readers or other assistive technologies.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Accessible Forms and Controls:</b>
                        <p>Web forms and interactive elements should be designed with proper labels, error messages, and 
                            keyboard accessibility in mind to assist users with disabilities.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Semantic HTML and ARIA: </b>
                        <p>Properly structured HTML and the use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications 
                            (ARIA) markup help screen readers and 
                            other assistive technologies understand the content and functionality of a webpage.

            <h3>Tab Index</h3>
            <p>The "tab index" is an attribute used in HTML forms to control the order in which elements 
                receive focus when a user navigates a web page using the keyboard's "Tab" key. It is particularly 
                important for web accessibility as it helps ensure that users with 
                disabilities can navigate and interact with a website efficiently.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Order of Focus:</b>
                <p>By default, HTML elements like form fields (e.g., text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons) and 
                    interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) receive focus in the order they appear in the HTML source code.
                     However, you can use the "tab index" 
                    attribute to specify a custom order for these elements.</p></li>
                <li><b>Positive Integer Values: </b>
                <p>The "tab index" attribute accepts positive integer values. Elements with lower values are 
                    focused first when the user presses the "Tab" key, 
                    and elements with the same "tab index" value are focused 
                    in the order they appear in the source code.</p></li>
                <li><b>Zero and Negative Values: </b>
                <p> Setting a "tab index" value of "0" means the element receives focus in its 
                    default order based on the source code. 
                    Avoid using negative values, as they can disrupt the natural flow of focus.</p></li>   
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, the "tab index" attribute in HTML allows web developers to control the keyboard navigation order of elements on a webpage. 
                It plays a crucial role in web accessibility by ensuring that users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact 
                with web forms and content effectively and intuitively. 
                However, it should be used judiciously and in accordance with best practices to enhance the user experience for all.</p>
